# hello-world
just another repository
I am happy to accept PRs for this repository, for changes big and small.  Please keep in mind, however, that changes to the repository have to be kept in sync with changes in the book.  Any work you can do in your PR to make it clear to me what changes need to be made in the book is very helpful to me.
